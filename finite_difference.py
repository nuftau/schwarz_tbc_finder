    Returns the tridiagonal matrix Y in the shape asked by solve_linear.
    (Does not actually returns a np matrix, it returns (Y_0, Y_1, Y_2).

    The returned matrix is of dimension MxM
    Lambda is the free parameter of Robin boundary conditions

    The following parameters can either be given as floats or np.ndarray

    h: step size (>0 in Omega_2, <0 in Omega_1) (size: M-1)
    D: diffusivity (always positive) (size: M-1)

    a: advection coefficient (should be positive) (size: M-2)
    c: reaction coefficient (should be positive) (size: M-2)

    If upper_domain is True, returns Y2; otherwise returns Y1
    (The upper domain is \Omega_2)
